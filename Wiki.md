# Welcome to the DEMO of the Lambert iGEM Wiki
Modify this page below as you see fit. This is just to give you an idea of how to use Markdown to code the wiki

Assume that anything purple on this page will be color-coded by committee. [See here for more info](https://github.com/Lambert-iGEM-2022/Wiki-Instructions#committee-colors)

> **IMPORTANT:** On this preview, we are unable to render custom components that you see [here](https://github.com/Lambert-iGEM-2022/Wiki-Instructions#committee-colors). However, if you want to use them, include them here and send us the Markdown file including them. They will work on the official wiki, just not on this unofficial preview.

Use [instructions from iGEM HQ](https://gitlab.igem.org/2022/lambert-ga/-/blob/main/README.md) to upload pictures and videos, and give us the URLs in the Markdown file you submit to us.

When you send us your file, please make a comment at the top of the file with the header image URL.

`
[comment]: <> (This is how to write a comment)
`

[comment]: <> (Comments are not visible in the preview)

When you are ready to send us your file, go to the top menubar, click "Export As", "Markdown", and save it to your computer. Upload this .md file to the 2022 iGEM Team folder under Wiki>Markdown Files. Let us know once you have uploaded it by sending one of us a message.

**For images in Markdown**, you may use the format down below to display images for your own preview. But before you submit it to us, please replace it with the format you see in the [GitHub README](https://github.com/Lambert-iGEM-2022/Wiki-Instructions#basic-markdown-syntax) ("Images" under "Basic Markdown Syntax")
